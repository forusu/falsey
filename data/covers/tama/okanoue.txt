10 o'clock the clock rings out
vertical portrait I had taken
All the different living things afloat
Swell my body up from within its walls
And I feel really full

Breath that drains into thin air
Early in the morning, near the railroad
I'm entrapped within my head
As every little movement of my eyes
shifts the world instead

Oh the big tall ferris wheel we could see at the top of the hill at the fair
And all the fish that swim in the tank that you hold
know as well
that it's you who is there

even though I'm in my home
a raincoat i keep on through
shuffle shuffle noises it makes too
it is all those noises a whole day full
i have come to love

Someone, read the book again
So that asleep can fall the train
Visible at night the naked clouds
Loosen up all the speed before
They fall into the depths

Oh the big tall ferris wheel we could see at the top of the hill at the fair
And all the fish that swim in the tank that you hold
know as well
that it's you who is there

Oh the big tall ferris wheel we could see at the top of the hill at the fair
And all the fish that swim in the tank that you hold
know as well
that it's you who is there
