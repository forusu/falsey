In a moment that is so true to you, you stand right before my eyes
Helpless I can't find the words to say, and I utter with a faceless voice
Straddling through this ridiculous scene, that's what made it fall apart
The sunlight's slowly starting to eat at me
And I wish so badly that we were in love again

All of it all, at the same place, I can't help but think of all the times we had over here
Like a very polished spoon that's reflecting
all the days that just refuse to be bent
None of the words seem to be difficult
And yet none of them seem to be easy too
Only thing I know is that this I enjoyed
And I just wish that none of it would ever end

Sometimes within you and me
We'd become lovers and then
We kept dancing on and on, together all alone
Our broken laughter we so enjoyed, and after it all
the words that we both spoke
would exit through the night
never to be seen again

All of it all, at the same old place
all the things we'd do, let's do them all again and again
Polished and bent, like the silver spoon
reflecting your face
beautifully within itself

Your future self keeps calling out to you, strolling across all the memories
When you stumble a little and take a break,
a single firework bursts into the night

Sometimes within you and me
We'd become lovers and then
We kept dancing on and on, together all alone
Our broken laughter we so enjoyed, and after it all
the words that we both spoke
would exit through the night
never to be seen again

All of it all, at the same old place
all the things we'd do, let's do them all again and again
Polished and bent, like the silver spoon
reflecting your face
beautifully within itself

We kept dancing on and on, together all alone
Our broken laughter we so enjoyed, and after it all
the words that we both spoke
would exit through the night
never to be seen again

All of it all, at the same old place
all the things we'd do, let's do them all again and again
Polished and bent, like the silver spoon
reflecting your face
beautifully within itself

All of it all, at the same old place
all the things we'd do, let's do them all again and again
Polished and bent, like the silver spoon
reflecting your face
beautifully within itself

All of it all, at the same old place...
