up and down
on a broken carousel
up and down
like a bucket in a well
strange girl, Life
always bringing you delights
one day you'll be happy
and the next you'll want to die

up and down
as the pictures come and go
up and down
as the clock is ticking slow
toughen up, you are falling from the top
at the bottom you'll be singing
at the bottom you will rot

wear a crown
like a merry little clown
go away
you were never meant to stay
draw a smile on your face
drink away inside your place

dreams and hopes drawn in crayon on the walls
picture book of all your life
so you ponder what went wrong
skies and stars shining brightly from above
as you dig a deeper hole
until you hit bedrock
up and down, drink and smoke
strange girl Life is there
to test if you are strong

up and down
and now it's all a mess
strange girl, Life
no longer wants your dress
liven up, the pictures on your wall
are singing all in unison
"you shouldn't have been born"

Knock on glass
The portrait on the wall
The lights up above
The embers down below

"What went wrong" 
"How did I get here?"
Ask yourself away
as you drink another beer
The cigarette, smothered in the tray
char inside your lungs
and the bugs inside your brain

dreams and hopes, drawn in pencil over scars
could've maybe turned into - a painting in the past
cry and thrash, however much you want
it won't help
as you are here to rot
