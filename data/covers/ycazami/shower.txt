Come on swallow me, in this incredible rain
A simple crime that took only half an hour, as if nothing ever had happened
So suddenly, I feel that I need to shut myself away
Again I caught myself in love with this shower

When the darkness comes, where no one's eyes could see
when it vanishes, completely
I'll hide in the scent
of the petrichor in here, that smothers me

Come on swallow me, in this incredible rain
A simple crime that took only half an hour, as if nothing ever had happened
So suddenly, I feel that I need to shut myself away
And yet I caught myself in love with this shower

So come and cleanse me, make it the heaviest rain
As long as I can breathe I feel malaised and I'm slowly losing my sanity
Intensely and with a painfully damning haste
I've realised that I'm enthralled by this shower

I've realised that I'm enthralled by this shower
