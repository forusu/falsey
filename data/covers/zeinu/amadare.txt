A hazy sky above my head
hydrangea whispers quietly:
"good morning, weather's beautiful today"
Well I don't know

The asphalt getting wet again
The feet are slipping out and I
have bumped my knees and fell below
just like all of you

I kept getting lost within
corners of this big old map
and a silent wish appeared to stand before me
Waiting

I kept looking all within
middle of this map again
that was eaten by the insects
with the holes around

I was stopped by distant echoes
of the frogs that sung to me
in the silence when they stopped their croaking
my restless heart is feeling all alone
but the sound of frogs has started ramping up and up again
in the bustle of the life it brought me
my heart let out a sigh and calmed itself
in the middle of this hillside road
blown through by the passing wind

I was stopped by croaking echoes of the frogs that sung to me
in the silence when they stop their croaking
my restless heart feels all alone
I have heard a distant me-cha-nical tone of something there
and only when it had faded
Did I know that I was truly a-live
In the middle of this hillside road
Blown - through - by the passing wind
