Dark is the night
Only bullets are flying through steppes
Only wind howling through empty streets
As the stars dimly twinkle... 

On this dark night
I'm aware, you're not sleeping, my dear
Slowly wiping a tear from your face 
Sitting by the old nightstand

Oh how I love
All the depth in your beautiful eyes 
Oh what I'd give
To just touch them again
With my lips

Dark is the night
That's dividing, my dear, you and me
And this dark and disquiet big steppe
Has been laid in-between us

In you I believe
My beloved and dear only friend
And this faith has protected me in
This dark night from a bullet 

I'm filled with joy
I am calm in a battle for death
Knowing that you will meet me with love
No matter what happens

I don't fear death
We have met it a lot in the steppes
And now again
It comes circling
Right above me

For me you await
And by nightstand I know you're awake
And because of this knowing I know
That I will be okay
